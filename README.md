# Calm Bot

The chatbot that I've created is Calmbot. It talks the user into meditation. Following were the changes made = 

1. Added background of a calm enviroment
2. Added beep sound for questions and to draw attention when the meditation is done.
3. Modified the text input to have placeholders
4. Modified the appearance to contrast with the background image
5. Modified the bot state to correspond to a calm person talking to you
6. Added benefits description & jokes nudgets to pursuade user to meditate.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
It's a calm box that inspires you to meditate. Had to break the video into 2 because the subject started meditating for a minute!
